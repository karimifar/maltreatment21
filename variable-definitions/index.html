                            This factor is the main driver of our risk models for children younger than 10. We find that these risks, are highly correlate and present in many communities with economic disadvantage. However, when these indicators are low for a community, it tends to be low risk for maltreatment, even if the community is high in economic disadvantage.

                                Having a relatively large proportion of adults receiving disability benefits can be driven by two processes. The first process is that adults in the community tend to be employed in jobs and sectors with high rates of injury. The second process is that the community has a high percent of adults with debilitating mental health disorders or substance use disorders. To help understand these two processes in a community, we recommend looking at this variable in conjunction with other data. In particular, if a community is in the high range of this variable, we recommend looking at the community’s prenatal drug exposure rate. If both are high, it is likely that the community may also suffer from high rates of substance use and poor access to mental health/substance use treatment.

                                Positive father involvement during pregnancy and after are a major protective factor for a variety of family outcomes. Research shows that when the father is named on the birth certificate, even when the parents are not married, it is an indication of involvement during pregnancy. In communities with low rates of father’s not being named on the birth certificate, consideration needs to be given towards supporting and encouraging positive father involvement, but also recognizing that mothers without a positive partner need more support during pregnancy and after to help mitigate the stress of this time.

                            Safety factor reflects a culture of safety in the community. Childhood injury is a multifactor problem that can reflect health literacy, risk taking, or parental monitoring. In all communities in Texas, the local trauma hospital is responsible for reducing injury in the community. We recommend that local coalitions and individual maltreatment reduction programs partner with these injury prevention teams for resources and to help address injury concerns in the community.

                            Infant mortality, like infant maltreatment is a multifaceted problem with no one clear cause or approach to prevent it.

This indicates that there are shared underlying factors contributing to both, outside of the ones named here.

                            This metric reflects the level of violent crime involvement in the community among adults. Unlike other crime statistics, this metric reflects where the individual involved lived, not where the incident took place. This adult metric is important for both 10-14 year old and 15-17 year old maltreatment risk.

                            Maltreatment risk across age groups is such that the further apart in age, the lower the correlation. For 15 to 17 year olds, they share maltreatment risk with 10 to 14 year olds, but not with younger children. This means that the same underlying risk for maltreatment that we see with 10 to 14 year olds, applies to 15 to 17 year olds. These relationships across ages also means that if an organization want to reduce maltreatment across all age groups, their approach and which communities are targeted may be different for younger and older age groups.
